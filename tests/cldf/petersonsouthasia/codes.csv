B-3,B,3,three classes (M/F/N)
C-0,C,0,affixal plural
C-1,C,1,enclitic plural marker (with a largely constant form) or free-standing phonological word
C-2,C,2,basically enclitic but with considerable morphophonological variation which is not entirely due to phonotactic constraints
D-0,D,0,one invariable stem
D-1,D,1,"two stems, “oblique” stem not a productive case"
D-2,D,2,"two stems, “oblique”stem is at least generally identical with genitive"
E-0,E,0,none
E-1,E,1,"found either in certain verbal categories only (typically non-imperfective past tense, e.g., Hindi), with only certain persons (e.g., Darai, 3rd person,singular), or potentially in all verbal categories with all persons with transitive predicates, dependent on other factors (e.g., Nepali)."
F-0,F,0,no
F-1,F,1,yes
G-0,G,0,no

I-0,I,0,none found
I-1,I,1,identical forms
I-2,I,2,"no formal identity, but signs of at least some previous similarity, e.g., Kharia *tay* ‘from’ and *khoʔtay* ‘to’ (`<*`*khoʔ tay* ‘from the place’) or Konkani *ajun* ‘up to today’ (*<aji-un* ‘today-ABL’, cf. Master 1964: 153; 156; 170, (under the entry “*ājhuiṃ*”))"

L-0,L,0,none
L-1,L,1,"yes, but only in some persons (e.g., Sadri, only found in the 3rd person)"
L-2,L,2,"yes, in all persons. Here we include cases such as Remo, for which we have only one example but which clearly seems to fit the overall pattern, i.e., the usual means in Munda languages in which the noun is followed by an enclitic/suffixal person marker, in this case the 2nd person, singular, so that it is clearly different from the Sadri case above(cf. Anderson and Harrison 2008a: 576)."

T-1,T,1,yes – regular and productive
T-2,T,2,object marking is found but generally not subject marking

U-0,U,0,no
U-1,U,1,"yes, on finite predicates (and perhaps also non-finite)."
U-2,U,2,"yes, but only non-finite forms"
U-3,U,3,"form contains a finite and a non-finite element, e.g., the form “Verb-*an* Verb-*le*” found in Sora (Anderson and Harrison 2008b: 346), where the second form (in *-le*) is a finite form but the first form is not."
V-0,V,0,no

AA-1,AA,1,yes (morphological or periphrastic)
AB-0,AB,0,none found
AB-1,AB,1,"some form of obligatory number neutralization is found, e.g., Bengali, where the singular /plural distinction found with nouns is not found with verbs, which show no number distinctions. This group also includes languages where the neutralization affects only part of the verb system, e.g. Remo, which has a singular /dual /plural distinction with pronouns and verbs in the 1st and 2nd persons, but not on verbs for 3rd persons, Gtaʔ, where the dual /plural opposition is neutralized in the first person only, or Gorum, where there is number neutralization in 3rd person object marking."
AB-2,AB,2,"found, but typically “optional”, e.g., Kharia, where the dual marker *=kiyaror* the plural marker *=ki* are optional with nouns and where the predicate in 3rd persons may optionally mark for non-singular number. This also includes Bhojpuri, where e.g. Verma (2003: 531) writes that number is basically not marked on verb forms – only person and honorific status – although it is optionally marked periphrastically."

AC-1,AC,1,yes
AC-2,AC,2,"yes, but the first consonant is also replaced by another consonant, e.g., by /g/ in Kuvi, or by /b/, e.g., in Marathi."
